Create an empty HTML project and initialise a local git repository

BASE gives user an empty html project with css, javascript, and assets folder. You can alter js and css right out of the box.


## How To

1. To use BASE make sure you have Python(or Python3) installed on your system
2. In the directory with run.py run command
> python run.py

or if you have python 3

> python3 run.py
3. Create directory name
4. Put absolute path where you want the directory to live

## You're Done

Note this also initializes a local git repo
